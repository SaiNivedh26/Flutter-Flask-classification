# Classification Flutter App by [Sai Nivedh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sainivedhai/)

In this App, Ive Made an API call to hosted docker image from flutter and Sent image from flutter to flask and got back predictionÂ result

* Note that as model size is huge , I have given a [direct link](https://github.com/SaiNivedh26/Docker-Dog-Cat-Classification/blob/main/Model.md) to drive where I've attached the model file
